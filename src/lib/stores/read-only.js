/**
 * Read-only mode - the session-wide promise that nothing gets written.
 *
 * A prop threaded from StudioShell reached the grid and the record view, which
 * left every other surface (the sidebar's Drop table, the structure editor's
 * ALTER/DROP buttons, the AI tool calls, Backup's restore) free to write on a
 * connection the user had explicitly opened read-only.
 *
 * So the flag lives here instead, and the real gate sits in `api.js` where every
 * mutation funnels through: even a path nobody remembered to disable is refused.
 * Components import `readOnlyMode` to *show* the state - disabled buttons, a
 * reason in the tooltip - but they are not what enforces it.
