  /**
   * The focused cell, full size, docked under the grid.
   *
   * A grid row is 28px tall, which is the wrong surface for a paragraph of
   * markdown, a stack trace, a 40-line JSON payload or a SQL snippet stored in a
   * text column - the inline editor shows one line of it and scrolls the rest
   * sideways. Space opens the same value here: the whole thing, wrapped,
   * editable, with the raw text and a read-only preview side by side when the
   * value is structured.
   *
   * It is a dock, not a dialog. A centred modal over a table put the value on
   * top of the rows it came from, dimmed the data you were comparing it against
   * and took the whole window for one field. The related-rows panel already
   * established where a second surface belongs in this app - along the bottom
   * edge, resizable, with the grid still live above it - so this sits in the
   * same place, wears the same chrome, and leaves the row it belongs to visible.
   *
   * It stages, it does not write. Stage change hands the value back on exactly
   * the path the inline editor uses, so it lands in the same staged-changes
   * queue with the same undo and the same Apply button.
   *
