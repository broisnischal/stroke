  /**
   * The frame the provider sign-in flows live in.
   *
   * Cloudflare and the OAuth providers each used to draw their own idle CTA,
   * waiting card, loading row and error card. Four shapes per provider, none of
   * them the same size, so every step of a sign-in resized the pane under the
   * cursor.
   *
   * This is one block with four tones, and deliberately NOT a card: a bordered
   * box floating above the form it belongs to reads as an advert, not as the
   * first step of the form. It is a section - icon, copy, one action, a rule -
   * flush with the fields below it and the same width as them. The rule doubles
   * as the progress track, so a long wait can show life without a bar appearing
   * out of nowhere and pushing everything down.
