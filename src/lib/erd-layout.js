 * between them wide enough for the relationship lines that run there. Dagre
 * reserves space for the cards it lays out, but that guarantee doesn't survive
 * everything that happens afterwards - a hand-dragged card keeps its saved
 * position, a re-flowed rank packs sub-columns on its own terms, and a card whose
 * column list changed is a different size than the one the layout measured. Any
 * of those can leave cards overlapping, and an overlapping card is worse than a
 * crossed line: it hides data.
 *
 * So the positions are pushed apart until every pair is clear, as the last step
 * before anything is drawn. It's a relaxation, not a re-layout: cards move as
 * little as possible, so the shape Dagre found survives.

 * Wrap over-tall ranks into sub-columns.

 * A ranked layout puts every node of a rank in one column, and a schema with a
 * hub puts most of the schema in one rank: a `users` table that ninety others
 * carry a foreign key to gives a second rank ninety cards tall. The diagram comes
 * out around 1:10 - a vertical strip unreadable at any zoom, every line in it
 * running the full height. Nothing about the layout is wrong; that is just the
 * shape a rank is.
 *
 * So a rank taller than the page is folded into as many sub-columns as it needs,
 * in the order the layout chose, and the ranks after it shift right to make room.
 * The crossing work the layout did is kept - only the column it did it in
 * changes.
 *
 * Two things this deliberately does not do. It leaves a diagram that is already a
 * reasonable shape completely alone, because folding one costs its vertical
 * alignment for nothing. And when it does fold, it re-flows every rank from a
 * shared top: a rank that keeps its old absolute y sits thousands of pixels below
 * the rank it belongs beside, which was most of the height in the first place.
 *
 * Cards land on a uniform grid per rank, so no two can overlap by construction.
 * The layout's own edge corridors do NOT survive: the space they were reserved in
 * has moved, so a caller that folds has to route those lines instead.
