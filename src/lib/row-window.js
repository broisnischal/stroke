/**
 * Sizing rules for windowed row browsing.
 *
 * A "window" is one chunk of a large result set. What decides the chunk size is
 * BYTES, not rows: a window response crosses the Tauri bridge and is decoded in a
 * single task, so 5k narrow rows (~0.6MB) is nothing while 5k rows of a table with
 * an embedding column (~17KB each) is ~90MB and freezes the app for seconds.
 *
 * So a large load fetches a small probe first, measures its rows, and sizes
 * everything from that. Pure functions here; the stateful part (which windows are
 * resident, what's in flight) lives in StudioShell.

 * between fetches. Ordering by the primary key gives every window one total order
 * to slice, so row N is row N.
 *

 * ordering by a non-unique column alone has ties whose order is equally arbitrary.
